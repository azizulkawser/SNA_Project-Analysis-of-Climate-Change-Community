Uncovering the Climate Change Conversation on Twitter: Analyzing Hashtags, Communities, and Sentiments.
Project Description
The problem statement for this project is to analyze the social media activity related to climate change by identifying the most popular hashtags, the regional locations and languages associated with them, and the sentiment expressed in the tweets. 

Additionally, the aim is to build a social graph of hashtags based on their co-occurrence in tweets, and to analyze its properties such as the number of nodes, edges, degree centrality, clustering coefficient, and size of the largest component. 

The project also aims to identify communities within the social graph and analyze their characteristics. Furthermore, the project seeks to identify potential bots in the most popular hashtags, and quantify the amount of support each hashtag receives based on retweets and replies. The results will be interpreted in the context of the existing literature on climate change.
