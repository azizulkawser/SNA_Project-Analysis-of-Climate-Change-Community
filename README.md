## <font color = 'black'> Project description </font>
<font color = 'black'> <li> The problem statement for this project is to analyze the social media activity related to climate change by identifying the most popular hashtags, the regional locations and languages associated with them, and the sentiment expressed in the tweets.</li> <li>Additionally, the aim is to build a social graph of hashtags based on their co-occurrence in tweets, and to analyze its properties such as the number of nodes, edges, degree centrality, clustering coefficient, and size of the largest component.</li><li>The project also aims to identify communities within the social graph and analyze their characteristics. Furthermore, the project seeks to identify potential bots in the most popular hashtags, and quantify the amount of support each hashtag receives based on retweets and replies. The results will be interpreted in the context of the existing literature on climate change.</li>

## <font color = 'black'> Methodology </font>
<font color = 'black'> Structural-Functional approach was used in this project. <li>This approach focuses on the patterns of connections between nodes and how these patterns influence the functioning of the network as a whole.</li><li>For example, this project includes tasks such as identifying important nodes in the network, analyzing the network's degree centrality and clustering coefficient, and examining the distribution of connections between nodes. </li><li>By this approach we are identifying key nodes and analyzing the overall network structure and dynamics.</li></font>
