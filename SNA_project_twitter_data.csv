 Klaus Schwab‘s father was basically a Nazi that ran forced labor camps…

This is probably why he was chosen or had the privilege of running the great reset….

If you don’t know who he is you need to do more research on the world economic forum…

The science is settled but we just found 19,000 new #volcanoes. We've only mapped about a quarter of the ocean floor, but we *knew* in 1992 those seamounts couldn't affect currents, cause upwelling, change ocean ecology or contribute to #climatechange.

No one needs to “believe” in climate change. You should at least try to understand the science. Then, if you have a valid argument against #AGW, you can present that based on the science. Again, no belief required.

No #littleiceage now, no #miniiceage when the sun, around 2060-70 goes into a GSM.

CO2 is driving climate now. The sun does not drive climate, except over geologic time (6% brighter now than in Cambrian times.)

#AGW is warming us, past any previous warm period in the holocene.

It is clear that we are warmer than at any stage in the Holocene Optimum. Your crap about us still warming up from the LIA is shown as a complete fabriocation.

We also know that the Milankovitch Cycle is still turning down—we should be cooling!

The warming is not natural! #AGW!

The winners writing of history using glorified yet offensive terms is your problem. Has nothing to do with data collection nor the resulting understanding of #AGW - deflection at best, subtly manipulative at worst. What is your point?

If you made $53,000 a day or $20 million per year since Jesus was born you would still not make the profit Shell made in 2022.

It’s time for Shell to Stop Drilling and Start Paying for the climate damage they’ve caused.

And this effect (higher temps at night) would be primarily driven by land modification and heat islands as opposed to the atmospheric concentration of CO2. We should have NO expectation of a response in temperature to a reduction of CO2. #climate

Replying to @hausfath @RyanMaue and @BerkeleyEarth
What is very interesting is that it is night-time temperatures that are warming most. The average temp = (Tmax + Tmin)/2 which is increasing but the range (Tmax-Tmin) is decreasing. This implies AGW mostly reduces cooling at night.

Is it because of Tar sands? and #BigOIl there?

I keep getting messages that 30C is totally normal beginning of may

The truly sensational #Climate event of 2023 

NO SEA ICE around #Thwaites in April 

michael mann is right to be optimistic 
And so is zeke about land use as a solution to the  #ClimateCrisis 

Seriously, who predicted this, or even thought it might happen?

He’s absolutely right, climate change is a scam.

I learned this in the work I did in renewable energies.

And it’s confirmed by where rich people and banks put their money.

They would never buy—or finance—beachfront property if global warming were true.

Just dirt beneath our feet? No way! Soil is the priceless foundation of all life on Earth.

It is critically important for climate change mitigation, ecosystem restoration, and it is where our food begins.

“Climate change” is not an excuse for open borders.

What are foreign countries doing with the billions of American tax dollars we’re sending overseas to combat climate change?

King Charles III, formerly Prince Charles, has given the strongest possible endorsement to radical Great Reset policies, in giving a speech to mark the launch of the project.

There is no evidence of warming in the past eight years. 
Therefore there can be no evidence of CO2 causing warming. 

So no, we don’t need a Climate Change Commission. 
And we certainly don’t need to give a Climate Change Commission more powers.

Climate change is too important, to be left to the vagaries of party politics. 

The Climate Change Commission should be given powers similar to the reserve bank.

Atmospheric CO2 has been much higher in the past, and life flourished. More CO2=more plants=more oxygen for animals to breath. CO2 is currently 400ppm of the atmosphere, if it falls below 200ppm=no plants=no oxygen=no animals. DeathwishNet Zero intends it to be less than 200ppm.

Biden is 80 years old, and would be 86 by the end of a second term. While many voters see his age as cause for concern, a campaign strategist says there are upsides to his decades of experience.

It’s time for Shell to Stop Drilling and Start Paying for the climate damage they’ve caused.

Check out this sign: there hasn’t been ice on this pond for 20 plus years. Sign problem? No. Climate change problem.  Jamestown kids for generations including my own used to play hockey on this pond w/o issue.  We need to pick up our pace on climate. It won’t wait.  #ActonClimate

Elephants play important roles in engineering healthy ecosystems that in turn absorb CO2 and keep it out of the atmosphere. Elephants disperse seeds, fertilize soil, dig wells, create trails for other animals and clear space that encourages new plant growth.

 Higher temperatures are making it harder to produce food.

And for vulnerable rural communities, failed harvest seasons can mean meagre earnings and empty plates.

I’m 61 & have always voted Labour but no longer

I’m a leftwing Jew and Starmer makes it clear he despises people like me

He cringes to the Establishment & the rich

He lies & lies

He will not act on climate, poverty, human rights, social justice 

What is the point of Starmer?

Still only 1.23 inches of rain for the month, when average rain for April is 3.56 inches.

Flooding on the Mississippi. Drought in large parts of the rest of Iowa. No rain in 15-day forecast.

Spotlight on Iowa, which has been dealing with varying levels of drought since July 2020.

29.7% of IA is in drought, with an area of Extreme/Exceptional Drought in western IA.

April was unusually dry and the 8-14 day outlook also looks mostly dry.

Climate skeptics claim the Earth should be cooling due to Orbital cycles.

Not so . Recent warming overcomes that effect due to the excessive CO2 into Earth’s atmosphere from the burning of #FossilFuels.

Why Milankovitch (Orbital) Cycles Can’t Explain Earth’s Current Warming
Small variations in how Earth moves around our Sun influence long-term climate, but they can't account for Earth's current warming.

""Robust populations of just nine species, such as sea otters or gray wolves, or genera, including whales, could lead to the capture of 6.41 gigatons of CO₂ annually.""

We can #StopExtincton, #SaveTheWolves and #ActOnClimate at the same time!

Want to sequester carbon? Save wild animals.
Research shows protecting even a small number of animal species would help capture enough carbon to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Nuclear energy provides clean energy w/ utilization 6x that of Solar & w/o need for ESS or UHV lines. China expected to grow capacity to 400GW

As the largest consumer in the future, China also wants more control in Uranium pricing & supply security. See below for major Uranium…

Up until 2015, China tried out every possible nuclear design

Europe goes Nuclear!
Nuclear energy? Don't worry - our clean energy future is radioactive.
It would be nice if solar and wind energy could provide us with all the energy we need, but we will need nuclear energy.
So what is the status in Europe? An overview.
Let`s dive in!

Their proposed budget cuts will send good paying American jobs overseas.

But there’s another side — the chance we can get it right, stop climate change, and build a better future.

Here are some ways we might do that…

clean energy activists were banned from having a booth at SF earth day. the reason? the event’s organizers didn’t want to have nuclear power representation!

nuclear is the largest source of clean energy in california and in the country, it has to be a part of the conversation.

Nuclear Energy is part of the climate conversation - it provides 52% of our low-carbon energy in the U.S. 

& YET, SF Earth Day denied my friends & I from representing & advocating for one of the greatest low-carbon energy sources - nuclear energy.

Just now, the 
@HouseGOP
 passed H.R. 1, the #PollutersOverPeople Act 225-204. This is a reflection of the #FossilFuel industries’ influence over elected officials who have backed a bill that will increase profits for Big Oil & Gas and fails to act on climate, jobs, and justice.

Last year, we defeated Manchin’s #DirtyDeal ""permitting reform"" fossil fuel giveaway.

#BigOil lobbyists are pushing back hard. They got @JoeBiden to approve new fossil fuel projects, and are working with the @HouseGOP  to pass H.R.1, a bill that panders to corporate polluters.

#ClimateCrisis fun fact: Earth's atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon and 0.1% other gases. TRACE AMOUNTS of CO2, methane, water vapor, neon and others make up THE REMAINING 1%. CO2 makes up 0.04% of that (not 4%). 95% of that is natural. Man-made: 0.0016%.

As the Earth's temperature increases, glaciers & ice caps melt faster & contribute to more coastal destruction. Sea level has risen by 21 centimeters since 1945. The rate of rise is accelerating due to the human-caused #ClimateCrisis. Be serously concerned for your children.

The poster claims this video shows the results of ""...death and destruction from extreme weather"" caused by fossil fuels. 

It is actually from the great Japanese tsunami of 2011, an historic geological event unrelated by any known science to ""extreme weather"".

Changes in global temperature are caused primarily by solar cycles, not a trace gas (CO2) which makes up just 0.04% of the atmosphere, of which 95% comes from natural sources, not human…

Airlines want you to buy carbon offsets. Experts say they’re a ‘scam.’

16  years  ago  we  had  just  10  years  left  to  save  the  planet.  

‘Climate  Change’  was  going  to  cost  more  than  both  world  wars  combined.

However  insurance  data  shows  the  economic cost  of  bad  weather  continues  to  trend  downwards…

 Travelling from Dublin Airport this weekend? You might already know that the car parks are FULL. 

@emer_currie1 is calling on the Minister for Transport and Dublin Airport to address car parking shortages and cap car parking charges at a fair price.

The #GreenNewDeal movement is powerful because it’s intersectional: climate justice, racial justice, economic justice, social justice, and health justice. Now, we’ve got to get to the finish line.

Here are two ways to engage in climate justice advocacy.
 Use digital channels to raise awareness and challenge decision-makers.  
 Go to the communities and inquire about their situation, report and take concrete actions to help them.

50% of global emissions are emitted by just 10% of the population.

90% of global emissions by 50% of the population.

By 2050, the world's wind industry is expected to produce more than 47 million tons of blade waste each year — so finding ways to recycle windmill blades and used solar panels is crucial, those in the renewable energy industry say.

As renewables become more prevalent, finding ways to recycle renewable waste becoming more urgent
Solar panels can last for 25 to 30 years, but more than 90% of used panels end up in landfills.

CO2 comprises only 0.03% of our atmosphere. It has varied a a bit over the last 20,000 years, but no global warming. We should hope to increase it to 0.06%-0.08% so all plants could grow 50% faster. Decreasing it will suppress growth!

Records shouldn't last for a month!

The more hot something is, the more heat it radiates and faster it cools down again.

Unless it's forced to heat up more. 

The net anthropogenic climate forcing is rapidly increasing, leading to an unprecedented global warming rate.

Warner Bros picked it up but most of it was changed in production.

97% of that .04% is natural CO2 coming from land and oceans.
Therefore, human emissions are .0016% of the atmosphere. 
What’s all the fuss about? 
The global warming doomsday cult are bonkers.

The biggest greenhouse gas is H2O. Its amazing how adults believe that C02 has a bigger role, a tiny fraction of it.
Nobody really disputes that there is Natural C02, ref to Law of Henry, and Man made C02. To believe that the Natural Co2 is 280 ppm and constant, are for Nuts Only

Human activities, through emissions of #greenhousegases, have caused #globalwarming of 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels.

Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years.

Global Warming is usually shown as tiny variations in temperature on a very narrow range. 

Makes it look very big and scary

But what does it look like when seen within the real Zone of Human Habitation?

Like this:

Its 1/20,000th of a degree per day

40 degrees on one day last summer, taken at one town is global warming. 
But 50% of people still having their heating on throughout all of April is just weather.

Recent, rapid heating of world oceans has alarmed scientists concerned it will add to #globalwarming.

Before humans started burning fossil fuels, there was near equilibrium with how much CO2 nature created and how much nature could absorb. Though human contribution to CO2 is small, it is the reason for the continuing rise of greenhouse gas CO2 and the climate warming it causes.

Warner Bros picked it up but most of it was changed in production.

As our climate changes, so do plant climate zones.

Lacking legs, trees migrate 1 generation at a time…trees outlive us. In this way, planting a tree is less like seeding a rose garden and more like having a child.

Trees are moving north from global warming. Look up how your city could change.
As greenhouse gas emissions nudge temperatures higher, projections show trees’ growing ranges are shifting northward.

 #GlobalWarming  

 This will be much worse.

 The laws of physics are at work. 
 This will be much worse.

 CO2 will reach its maximum effect only after about 10 years in our atmosphere. 

 Then the effect lasts over 1000 years.

As greenhouse gas emissions nudge temperatures higher, projections show trees’ growing ranges are shifting northward.

Climate change doesn't threaten anything, except those who think climate change never changes.  Global warming actually enhances life on earth, while more CO2 (nature's plant food) helps grow food on earth and in the seas.  Therefore, produce more CO2.

A polar bear was killed in Norway after killing a man near a campsite in the Arctic.
